# task_2

1. Run the script "rot_faces.py" OR "rot_fsces.ipynb" and you will get the trained model that you can use for further prediction and evaluation.
2. I have done prediction on test images under "Testing" section. You can run that code to get the prediction on test images
3. In addition to this, as per submission instructions I have pushed corrected images file in zip file format (corrected.zip), prediction result (test.preds.csv)
.
