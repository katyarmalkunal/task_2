# task_2

1. Run the script "rot_faces.py" OR "rot_fsces.ipynb" and you will get the trained model that you can use for further prediction and evaluation.
2. I have done prediction on test images under "Testing" section. You can run that code to get the prediction on test images
3. Also I have pushed model.h5 (weights) and model.json (model) files on this repository. You can directly load and use that model & weights to perform further prediction & evaluation
